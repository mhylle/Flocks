# Flocks

A different kind of tower defense.
A game has 2 turns, an attack turn and a defense turn. 

You design the base. Making the roads and placing the defences. Then you defend against the attack.
After that you get to do an attack on the other player. 

<h4>Win conditions:</h4> 
Winning both attack and defence.
If it's a tie, and both the bases was lost, then the fastest attack wins
If it's a tie and both the bases was defended, then it's a real tie.


<h4>Troop types:</h4>

<b>Tank</b><br/>
Lots of hp, not a lot of damage

<b>Damage dealer</b><br/>
Regular damage dealer, not a lot of hp, lots of damage
